# Changes made since Part II
Since completing Part II, I focused on deepening the storytelling and clarifying the connection between concussions and CTE, which was the main area of confusion from my user interviews. In my Shorthand story, I added an entire section dedicated to explaining CTE, including both narrative text and a new line graph showing how the likelihood of developing CTE increases with years of football exposure. In addition, I incorporated findings from a JAMA study that analyzed CTE prevalence in former NFL players’ brains, creating a visualization of those results.

Most importantly, I added infographics that break down CTE by stage and another that summarizes concussion symptoms and prevention. These visuals tied the story together, leaving no doubt about how repeated concussions cause CTE and the direct relationship between football exposure and brain damage.

Going deeper with the Call to Action, I not only included the concussion infographic but also expanded the section to emphasize awareness of symptoms, the importance of not playing through head injuries, and available resources for parents, coaches, and players. This section truly tied the entire story together, shifting it from just information to meaningful action.

I also made some structural edits. I removed the state-by-state concussion comparison visualization, as it didn’t add much insight and disrupted the story flow. Instead, I added a breakdown of NFL concussion data by position, highlighting how rates differ across player roles and connecting it to the broader narrative on rule changes. I also expanded the discussion of how recent NFL rule changes have contributed to a downward trend in total concussions, an important point that shows progress while still emphasizing ongoing risk.

Finally, I created a three-level comparison between high school, NCAA, and NFL concussion rates. This breakdown showed the higher rates among youth players and how those rates decline at higher levels, reinforcing the idea that improved equipment, awareness, and policy changes are starting to make an impact, even if the problem isn’t fully solved.
## The audience
The primary audience for this campaign includes football athletes (but in truth, all athletes, no matter the sport), their parents, and coaches. These groups are the most directly involved in youth sports where concussions frequently occur, and they each play a role in identifying and responding to symptoms.

For students, the goal is to encourage honesty and awareness — showing that reporting a concussion isn’t a sign of weakness, but a step toward long-term health and better performance. Many athletes hide symptoms to stay in the game, so messaging needs to break that mindset and build a culture where safety is respected.

For parents, the campaign focuses on education and recognition. Through infographics and short, shareable content, they’ll learn to spot warning signs such as dizziness, confusion, nausea, and delayed responses. This helps parents understand when medical attention is needed, even if their child insists they’re “fine.”

For coaches and schools, the campaign highlights the importance of taking reports seriously and creating supportive environments where players feel safe speaking up. By including clear resources, such as links to CDC concussion guidelines and local sports medicine programs, the message extends beyond awareness to practical action.

The tone will stay real, direct, and relatable, using firsthand experience and credible data to connect with both students and parents. The ultimate goal is to shift the attitude from “play through it” to “protect yourself first,” reducing long-term risks while keeping trust and respect in the sport.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

For the final project, I aimed to create a cohesive and informative story that clearly connects concussions and CTE, using both data visualization and narrative structure to guide the audience from awareness to action. Every design choice was made to make the message more direct, emotionally resonant, and visually clear.

After completing user interviews, I realized the biggest gap was understanding how concussions actually lead to CTE. To address that, I added an entirely new section explaining CTE and visualized the relationship between years of football exposure and CTE risk through a line graph. I also incorporated the JAZA study visualization, which broke down CTE prevalence in NFL brains, giving the story scientific credibility and visual depth.

To make the data feel human, I used storytelling techniques that move from the personal level with players and symptoms to the broader implications with league data and rule changes. The decision to remove the state comparison chart came from this same principle, since it did not add much meaning to the narrative and distracted from the main story arc. Instead, I went deeper into NFL concussion data by position and a three-level comparison between high school, college, and professional football, which better highlighted the trend of concussion reduction and youth vulnerability.

For visuals, I made sure the color palette and layout supported the tone, using red for danger and awareness and balancing it with dark neutrals to keep the focus on clarity and seriousness. The infographic at the end served as both a summary and a call to action, encouraging viewers to recognize symptoms and take concussions seriously.

Ultimately, the final design combines storytelling, data accuracy, and emotional connection. It informs viewers about the science, shows them real impacts, and leaves them with clear steps to act, creating a complete and meaningful narrative around concussion awareness.
