# Wireframes / storyboards


The wirefram/storyborad is currently being made through shorthand, with an overarching story, and components not finalized or finished noted of to present the overarching story, even without all the necessary components to explore it.

## Target audience

My target audience is focused on current football players, parents of football players, and even to a smaller extend rule makers. My main focus on my traget audience is football players and parents, because a prominant fixture of football is many players fighting to play through injuries. While thats all good for sprains or muscle injuries, this logic just does not apply to concussions. I hope to not only explore the high concussion rates, but the CTE impact. Thereby, I can target towards pushing football players to report concussions and any injuries to the head, because of the potintial dangerous consequences of these injuries. Moreover, I hope to reach parents, who can be aware of potintial effects of concussions, and when their child is expeircning it to be aware of the many symptoms and consequences that can occur. Finally, rule makers at state and NFL level can see the porgress on rule chnages, and their state concussion rates to see if new rules should come forth, something I will delve much deeper in Part 3. 

## Interview script


Goal	Questions to Ask
Clarity of story:	Can you easily follow the narrative from youth to NCAA to NFL to CTE? Is there any point where you feel lost or need more background?
Effectiveness of visuals:	Do the charts/maps make sense to you? Is there any visualization that feels unclear, confusing, or unnecessary?
Impact of message:	After going through the draft, how do you feel about concussions in football? Do you think the story makes the risks clear?
Improvements:	If you had to change one thing, the order, the visuals, or the amount of detail, what would it be?


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

On Tuesday, I conducted three interviews in class on my project and asked four key questions that focused on narrative clarity, visual effectiveness, and overall impact. These interviews gave me valuable feedback and highlighted both strengths and areas for improvement.

The most consistent theme across all interviews was confusion around the relationship between concussions and CTE. While people followed the story from high school to NCAA to NFL fairly easily, several mentioned that the connection to CTE at the end was not fully clear. This showed me that I need to do more than just mention CTE, I need to explicitly show how repeated concussions can lead to CTE and why it is such a serious concern. This will be a central focus for Part Three of my project, as making this relationship clear is crucial to the audience understanding the story.

Another strong piece of feedback was the need for more visualizations about CTE. While my draft visuals on concussion rates were well received, people wanted to actually see the symptoms and long-term impact of CTE in order to fully understand the stakes. Suggestions included a chart or infographic that compares concussion symptoms versus CTE symptoms, or a timeline showing how effects can build up over time. These types of visuals will help reinforce the seriousness of the issue while also making my story more engaging and memorable.

The interviews also gave me confidence in the structure of my story. People liked the way I broke it down into three levels (youth/high school, NCAA, and NFL) and then tied everything together with CTE at the end. They described this as logical and easy to follow, and it confirmed that my basic framework works. The main improvements need to happen inside that framework, not with the framework itself.

When it came to the actual visualizations I have completed or am still developing, the reception was positive overall. People thought they were clear and helpful, but there were two recurring pieces of advice: (1) use color intentionally to highlight important comparisons or trends, and (2) make sure titles are strong and impactful. These comments stood out to me because I often overlook titles or treat them as an afterthought, but in reality, a strong title can set the tone for how the audience interprets a visualization. Color was also emphasized multiple times, it’s not just decoration but a tool I can use to guide attention.

Finally, interviewees gave me a few practical suggestions for improving the end of the story. One person recommended adding a “final takeaway” or call-to-action section that summarizes the message in plain language and leaves the audience with something to think about. This could be as simple as a closing slide with one or two strong statements that tie the narrative together and stress the importance of concussion awareness.

In summary, my key findings from the interviews were:
The connection between concussions and CTE needs to be made much clearer.
More visualizations are needed to show CTE symptoms and impacts.
The story structure (youth → NCAA → NFL → CTE) works well and is easy to follow.
Visuals should use color strategically and have stronger, more impactful titles.
A final takeaway section or call to action would strengthen the conclusion.
Overall, the interviews showed that my project has a strong foundation, but I need to refine the clarity of my message and lean more heavily on visuals and design to really drive the point home.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Can you easily follow the narrative from youth to NCAA to NFL to CTE? Is there any point where you feel lost or need more background? | I felt it was easy to follow and understand the story.             |     Felt their could be some more backround information on CTE, and to expand the story of concussion symptoms and CTE        |    Similar response to Interview 2.          |
|     	Do the charts/maps make sense to you? Is there any visualization that feels unclear, confusing, or unnecessary?|     Liked the charts, but suggested more vis for CTE data.                            |   Told me to focus on highlighting football, specfically in the concussion rates data.          |   Also liked the vis, nothing too specific, but again a focus on use of color was emphasized.          |
|After going through the draft, how do you feel about concussions in football? Do you think the story makes the risks clear? | Not exactly, they said was not enough info on the symptoms of concussions, and also some confusion about how concussions directly relate to CTE| Wanted to know what CTE does, and said maybe a visulization would help to truly describe the impacts of CTE |   Similar messaging as interview 1, was a little confued about how concussions and CTE all relate to each other          |
|If you had to change one thing, the order, the visuals, or the amount of detail, what would it be?| Add a final take away section on shorthand to wrap up the story and push a call to action| Go deeper into CTE, and use more visuals to convey the symptoms and effects of concussions and CTE| Again reiterated to show the connections between Concussions and CTE, either through additional text or a vis. 


# Identified changes for Part III


Going off the great insight I gained from the interviews, I gained many plans for what I want to incorporate into Part III. The table below delves into the exat finding from the interviews, and the anticipated changes based on these insight. 

Research synthesis|	Anticipated changes for Part III
Confusion around the connection between concussions and CTE.|	Add more background on what CTE is, and explicitly explain how repeated concussions can lead to it. Include a visualization that connects the two, and expand on the actual symptoms of both through a vis.
Need for more visuals on CTE symptoms and long-term impacts.|	Create new visuals/infographics to show symptoms of concussions vs. CTE. Like stated in the last change, I think an infograph would work best for both. 
Story structure (youth → NCAA → NFL → CTE) was strong and easy to follow.|	Keep the current structure but strengthen the transitions, especially when moving into the CTE section, to make the narrative flow smoother. Also add more design flair, but that will be a main focus of Part III as a whole. 
Positive reception of existing visuals, but advice to use color more intentionally.|	Refine color choices in charts/maps to highlight comparisons and emphasize key points. Titles of visuals not impactful enough.	Rewrite titles to be more engaging and informative, making them part of the storytelling instead of just labels.
Audience wanted a stronger conclusion or final takeaway.	Add a final “call to action” or takeaway slide that summarizes the risks of concussions and CTE clearly, and the explicit point of reaching my intended target audience. Maybe an infograph final take away slide, and thats where the infographs of concussions and CTE can go.                                                                             

# Final Thoughts

I want to say, these interviews have been a critical step in the process of finalizing my progress in this project. I now have an exact plan on how I ant to go about getting my story pushed through to the audience. I feel my shorthand progress does a good job of showing at least where the story is going. I am excited to share my results of this project on concussions as it does have a lot of salience with me. I just wanted to clarify, in many of the parts on shorthand, the story of why the data is saying what it is saying will be delved into during part III. I felt part II was good to get the intial story across, but more deeper insights into rules that help explain why the concussion data on each level is the way it is. Along with futher, deeper exploration of CTE data with inforgraphics for concussions and CTE.
