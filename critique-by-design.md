_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization


[Original Forbes Visualization](https://www.forbes.com/lists/athletes/?sh=162054105b7e)

The data visualization shows a ranked list of the top 10 highest-paid athletes, including their total earnings, on-the-field earnings, and off-the-field earnings. I’m an avid sports watcher, and I use social media all the time for sports news, analysis, or just talking with my friends about it. This visualization is one I see every year, and I remember seeing the latest version on Instagram not long ago. Whenever I see it, I end up wondering more about it—how does it compare across all sports, and who makes more from on-field earnings versus off-field endorsements? That’s why I chose this one to critique and redesign. My goal is to break it down into three separate graphs that tell a clearer story, highlight more hidden details, and finally answer the questions I’ve always had when looking at it.



## Step two: the critique
The data visualization presents a ranked list of the top 10 highest-paid athletes. While the data itself is compelling, especially for audiences interested in sports, business, or celebrity culture, the way it is presented limits its effectiveness. The table format is visually flat and difficult to scan quickly. There is no visual hierarchy or design elements to guide the viewer’s attention, and the lack of source citation or a clear time frame makes it harder to assess the context and reliability of the data. It acts as a plain table, with no overarching story being told through it.

Going through the categories of usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement, I’d say this is actually a pretty solid tool for critiquing the visualization. Starting with usefulness, the table is pretty effective for its audience. It communicates valuable information about the top-paid athletes and lays out all the numbers in a simple, straightforward way. For completeness, the visualization includes all the data points you need to understand the rankings, but it’s missing those story-driven elements that would really help highlight trends and deeper insights in the data.

Perceptibility is where it takes a hit. The table format works for its intended purpose and is easy enough to follow, but it doesn’t make hidden details pop out. A stacked bar chart, for example, would make those comparisons instantly clear and tell a bigger story. In terms of truthfulness and intuitiveness, though, it scores high. The numbers are accurate, coming directly from Forbes, and the table doesn’t mislead the audience. On top of that, it’s intuitive—everyone immediately understands the rankings and what the columns represent.

Aesthetics, however, are pretty weak. The table is bland, with no strong colors, no hierarchy, and nothing that visually draws you in. Finally, engagement is surprisingly high. Even though the original table itself is plain, I’ve seen it everywhere, especially because so many social media accounts redesign or repost it. Since those viral versions all trace back to this source, it’s clear that the visualization has strong engagement power, even if it’s not flashy on its own.


Overall, this table has strong data to work with, but very weak design. The simple use of a table is not visually appealing, and fails to capture the story driven elements that makes data viz so memorable. With a redesign to a new chart type, there can be further insight on hidden trends, and the data could better emphasize comparisons across athletes and sports, and create a more engaging experience for the audience.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
