> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

For this project, I am using multiple datasets to explore concussion rates across high school, NCAA, and NFL football, along with additional data examining CTE and its significance. I have a goal of identifying trends in sports with the highest concussion rates and exploring further through the NCAA and NFL concussion data. 

Starting with high school concussion data, this data comes from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and related CDC/NSC reports. This dataset provides concussion rates by state, sport, and gender/demographic. I will use this data to create a map visualization showing how concussion rates vary geographically across U.S. states for youth sports. I will additionally display the highest concussion rates across sports in ages 10-18 using data provided by a scholarly article called "Concussion in high school sports: findings from injury
surveillance".

After establishing football as the leading cause of concussions through the data, I will be looking at NCAA data to see if the trends fall similarly. First, I will start by examining concussion trends by collegiate sport, similar to what we did with youth/high school sports. For this part, I have two data sets, both from the Journal of Athletic Training. The first one, titled "Epidemiology of Concussions in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Sports", examines data from 2011-2015, examining concussion rates by sports. The second article is called "Epidemiology of Concussions in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Sports", so the same title and a continuation of the same study, but from 2015 to 2019. I hope to pull the data from these two journals and see how trends across sports have changed in terms of concussion rates. 

One limitation of NCAA concussion data is that the data is collected by a private organization, and therefore, public data is not accessible. In order to account for this, I decided to put an extra focus on the NFL. 

For the NFL, the data is provided by the NFL, from 2015 to 2024, as 2015 is when the NFL started collecting Data. In trying to find earlier data, it is nearly impossible, as earlier data is usually heavily undercounted. This data includes concussions per season for each year. An additional dataset provided via GitHub by scraping data from pro-football-reference allows for further breakdown by Team, players, and position. 

CTE DATA



> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your GitHub repository, Box account, or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available, please talk to me first.
