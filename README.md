# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool data visualizations will be located and sectioned off throughout the webpage. 

# About me
Hi! My name is Chris Strehl, and I’m currently in my second year of graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a degree in Public Policy and Data Analytics. I’m originally from the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania and completed my undergraduate studies at Chestnut Hill College, where I also played football.

I’m passionate about sports, especially football, baseball, and basketball, and I bring that same energy and teamwork mindset into my academic and professional life. I’ve had the opportunity to work at the Center for Political Accountability, contributing to their annual indexes. That experience deepened my understanding of the intersection between money and politics, and gave me a strong foundation in the rules and processes governing campaign finance and political accountability.

I also have had the opportunity to intern with Representative Robert Freeman of the 136th district in Northampton County. This gave me experience working not only with constituents, but furthermore seeing everyday life for a representative in Harrisburg, sitting in on caucus and house meetings. 

I’m especially excited about the power of data visualization to tell compelling stories and drive change. I look forward to sharing my work with you and learning from everyone in the class!

# What I hope to learn
Hi everyone! I'm excited to be part of Telling Stories with Data because I want to learn how to communicate complex ideas clearly and creatively using data. I’m especially interested in improving my skills in data visualization, storytelling, and using tools to make data more engaging and accessible.

I hope to learn how to design visualizations that not only look good but also tell meaningful stories that resonate with different audiences. I’m also curious about how to balance aesthetics with accuracy and how to choose the right chart or technique for different types of data.

After graduation, I plan to work in the government in some capacity, with a focus possibly towards budget analysis. I am passionate about money and its relationship in government, and I hope to use data to drive decisions and create an impact on budget analysis.

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  
[Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md)

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one.md)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other Examples of Work

Future examples of work outside these assignments will be posted here.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
