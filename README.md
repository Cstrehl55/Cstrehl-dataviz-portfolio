# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool data visualizations will be located and sectioned off throughout the webpage. 

# About me
Hi! My name is Chris Strehl, and I’m currently in my second year of graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a degree in Public Policy and Data Analytics. I’m originally from the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania and completed my undergraduate studies at Chestnut Hill College, where I also played football.

I’m passionate about sports, especially football, baseball, and basketball, and I bring that same energy and teamwork mindset into my academic and professional life. I’ve had the opportunity to work at the Center for Political Accountability, contributing to their annual indexes. That experience deepened my understanding of the intersection between money and politics, and gave me a strong foundation in the rules and processes governing campaign finance and political accountability.

I also have had the opportunity to intern with Representative Robert Freeman of the 136th district in Northampton County. This gave me experience working not only with constituents, but furthermore seeing everyday life for a representative in Harrisburg, sitting in on caucus and house meetings. 

I’m especially excited about the power of data visualization to tell compelling stories and drive change. I look forward to sharing my work with you and learning from everyone in the class!

# What I hope to learn
Hi everyone! I'm excited to be part of Telling Stories with Data because I want to learn how to communicate complex ideas clearly and creatively using data. I’m especially interested in improving my skills in data visualization, storytelling, and using tools to make data more engaging and accessible.

I hope to learn how to design visualizations that not only look good but also tell meaningful stories that resonate with different audiences. I’m also curious about how to balance aesthetics with accuracy and how to choose the right chart or technique for different types of data.

After graduation, I plan to work in the government in some capacity, with a focus possibly towards budget analysis. I am passionate about money and its relationship in government, and I hope to use data to drive decisions and create an impact on budget analysis.

## Final project
For my final project, I examined concussion rates across different levels of football, including high school, the NCAA, and the NFL. The goal of this project was to compare how concussion rates differ between these levels, analyze how rule changes in the NFL have affected concussion trends over time, and explore how these trends connect to long-term health impacts such as CTE.

The project goes beyond the data to show the true consequences of football, using visuals and infographics to explain the stages of CTE and highlight concussion symptoms that players, parents, and coaches should be aware of. Overall, this project serves as both an analysis and a resource, aimed at increasing awareness of how concussions develop, how they can be prevented, and why they matter at every level of the game.
